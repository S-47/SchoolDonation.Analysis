In this project we will analysis some files that contains big data with information about school's donation.
We will use libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, cufflinks in order to "play " with these data
We'll have to:
1) Find which 10 states have the most number of schools that opened projects to gather donations?
2) Find what are the top 10 states in which schools gathered most amount of average donations for their projects?
3) Analyse the Maximum, minimum, mean, median, 25% and 75% percentiles of Donations
4) Find in which states there are more donations done by donors? 
5) Find if is there a relationship between the number of projects offered and number of donations made by donors."
       Which state performing better in this case? How many of them responding project requests
       below average and which states are performing best in terms of donations per project?
6) Find how many different project types exists    
7) How many project subject category trees exists? Which ones attracted the most donations?
8) What is the mean time that takes a project to be fully funded after posted and how it varies between states?
9) Calculate the average  funding time for each state
10)Find which states are the best and which are the worst performing in terms of this criteria
        (mean project fully funded time )
